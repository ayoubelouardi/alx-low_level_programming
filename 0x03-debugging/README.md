# 0x03. C - Debugging

This project focuses on the essential skill of debugging in C programming. It involves identifying and correcting errors in existing code, emphasizing manual debugging techniques before moving on to more advanced tools. The project reinforces the importance of understanding error messages and employing systematic approaches to find and fix bugs.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

* Explain the debugging process.
* Describe various manual debugging methods.
* Interpret and understand error messages effectively.


## Project Description

The project consists of several tasks, each presenting a C code snippet with a bug or an area for improvement. The tasks require you to:

1. **Test existing code:** Write a `main` function to test provided functions, highlighting potential issues.
2. **Correct infinite loops:** Identify and comment out the section of code causing an infinite loop without altering the line count.
3. **Fix logical errors:** Correct the logic in a function to ensure it produces the correct output in all cases.
4. **Handle leap years:** Modify a function to correctly handle leap years when calculating remaining days in a year.

The project emphasizes understanding the code's logic and using manual debugging techniques to identify and resolve errors. Copying solutions is strictly prohibited.


## Tasks

The project includes the following tasks:

* **0. Multiple mains:** This task involves creating a `main` function to test a given function (`positive_or_negative`) for a specific input (0). It highlights the importance of thorough testing.

* **1. Like, comment, subscribe:** This task focuses on identifying and commenting out the code responsible for an infinite loop in a given `main` function. It emphasizes the practical application of debugging techniques.

* **2. 0 > 972?:** This task requires fixing a function (`largest_number`) that incorrectly determines the largest of three integers. It tests your ability to debug logical errors.

* **3. Leap year:** This task involves correcting a function (`print_remaining_days`) that doesn't accurately handle leap years when calculating remaining days in a year. It assesses your understanding of leap year calculations and your ability to debug complex logic.


## Files

The project includes the following files:

* `0-main.c`
* `1-main.c`
* `2-largest_number.c`
* `2-main.c`
* `3-convert_day.c`
* `3-main_a.c`
* `3-main_b.c`
* `3-print_remaining_days.c`
* `main.h`


## Requirements

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` (except where specified otherwise).
* All files must end with a new line.
* Code must adhere to Betty style.


This README provides a comprehensive overview of the 0x03. C - Debugging project. Each task presents a unique debugging challenge, reinforcing the importance of careful code analysis and systematic error correction.
