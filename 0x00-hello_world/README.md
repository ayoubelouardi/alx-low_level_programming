## About

This project introduces the basics of C programming, including:
- Writing and compiling C programs.
- Using the preprocessor to generate intermediate files.
- Compiling C code into object files and assembly code.
- Using standard library functions like `puts` and `printf`.
- Understanding data types and their sizes.

Each task is designed to build foundational skills in C programming and prepare you for more advanced topics.

## Tasks

### Mandatory Tasks

1. **0-preprocessor**  
   - **Purpose**: Run a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
   - **File**: `0-preprocessor`

2. **1-compiler**  
   - **Purpose**: Compile a C file into an object file without linking.
   - **File**: `1-compiler`

3. **2-assembler**  
   - **Purpose**: Generate the assembly code of a C file and save it in an output file.
   - **File**: `2-assembler`

4. **3-name**  
   - **Purpose**: Compile a C file and create an executable named `cisfun`.
   - **File**: `3-name`

5. **4-puts.c**  
   - **Purpose**: Write a C program that prints a specific message using `puts`.
   - **File**: `4-puts.c`

6. **5-printf.c**  
   - **Purpose**: Write a C program that prints a specific message using `printf`.
   - **File**: `5-printf.c`

7. **6-size.c**  
   - **Purpose**: Write a C program that prints the size of various data types on the computer.
   - **File**: `6-size.c`

### Advanced Tasks

8. **100-intel**  
   - **Purpose**: Generate the assembly code of a C file in Intel syntax and save it in an output file.
   - **File**: `100-intel`

9. **101-quote.c**  
   - **Purpose**: Write a C program that prints a specific quote to standard error without using `printf` or `puts`.
   - **File**: `101-quote.c`

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-low_level_programming.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd alx-low_level_programming/0x00-hello_world

3. Compile and run the C programs:
```

* For example, to compile and run 4-puts.c:
bash
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 4-puts.c -o puts  
./puts
```
4. Execute the scripts:

* For example, to run the preprocessor script:
```bash
./0-preprocessor
```

---

### Requirements

* All programs and scripts are compiled and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
* Code is written in C and follows the Betty style guide.
* Programs are compiled using gcc with the following flags:

```bash
-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
```
