# ALX Low-Level Programming - 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

This project focuses on mastering the basics of C programming, including variables, conditionals, loops, and the use of the putchar function. It involves writing programs to handle random numbers, print alphabets, generate number combinations, and manipulate digits, all while adhering to strict constraints on function usage and code structure.

## About

This project introduces the basics of C programming, including:
- Writing and compiling C programs.
- Using conditionals (`if`, `else`) to make decisions in code.
- Working with loops (`while`, `for`) to repeat tasks efficiently.
- Generating and manipulating random numbers.
- Printing characters and strings using the `putchar` function.
- Understanding and working with different data types.
- Printing numbers and alphabets in various formats.
- Generating combinations of numbers with specific constraints.
- Adhering to strict coding standards and constraints.
- Building foundational skills for more advanced programming tasks.

Each task is designed to build foundational skills in C programming and prepare you for more advanced topics.

## Tasks

### Mandatory Tasks

1. **0-positive_or_negative.c**
   - **Purpose**: Print whether a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.
   - **File**: `0-positive_or_negative.c`

2. **1-last_digit.c**
   - **Purpose**: Print the last digit of a randomly generated number and classify it based on its value.
   - **File**: `1-last_digit.c`

3. **2-print_alphabet.c**
   - **Purpose**: Print the lowercase alphabet using `putchar` twice.
   - **File**: `2-print_alphabet.c`

4. **3-print_alphabets.c**
   - **Purpose**: Print the lowercase and uppercase alphabet using `putchar` three times.
   - **File**: `3-print_alphabets.c`

5. **4-print_alphabt.c**
   - **Purpose**: Print the lowercase alphabet excluding the letters `q` and `e` using `putchar` twice.

   - **File**: `8-print_base16.c`

10. **9-print_comb.c**
    - **Purpose**: Print all possible combinations of single-digit numbers separated by `, ` using `putchar` four times.
    - **File**: `9-print_comb.c`

### Advanced Tasks

11. **100-print_comb3.c**
    - **Purpose**: Print all possible combinations of two different digits in ascending order using `putchar` five times.
    - **File**: `100-print_comb3.c`

12. **101-print_comb4.c**
    - **Purpose**: Print all possible combinations of three different digits in ascending order using `putchar` six times.
    - **File**: `101-print_comb4.c`

### How to Use

[ make it later ]

### Requirements

### Requirements

- All programs and scripts are compiled and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Code is written in C and follows the Betty style guide.
- Programs are compiled using `gcc` with the following flags:  
  ```bash 
  -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
  ```
- The use of certain functions (e.g., `printf`, `puts`) is restricted in some tasks.
- Programs must adhere to specific constraints, such as limiting the use of `putchar` to a certain number of times.
- No global variables are allowed unless explicitly permitted.
- All code must be contained within the `main` function unless otherwise specified.
- Programs must produce the exact expected output as described in each task.
