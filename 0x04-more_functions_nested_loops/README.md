## About

This project, **0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops**, is designed to deepen your understanding of key programming concepts in C. By completing the tasks, you will gain practical experience and improve your ability to write efficient, structured, and clean code. Hereâ€™s what you will learn:

- **Nested Loops**:
  - How to use nested loops effectively to solve problems.
  - Understanding the flow of control in nested loops.

- **Functions**:
  - How to define and use functions in C.
  - The difference between function declarations and definitions.
  - How to create and use function prototypes.

- **Variable Scope**:
  - Understanding local and global variable scope.
  - Best practices for managing variable scope in functions.

- **Code Optimization**:
  - Writing efficient code with minimal use of resources (e.g., limiting the use of `_putchar`).
  - Solving problems under strict constraints.

- **Debugging and Testing**:
  - How to test functions and debug code effectively.
  - Using compiler flags like `-Wall`, `-Werror`, `-Wextra`, and `-pedantic` to catch errors.

- **Problem-Solving**:
  - Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks.
  - Implementing algorithms to solve specific problems (e.g., Fizz-Buzz, prime factors).

- **Coding Standards**:
  - Adhering to the Betty style guidelines for clean and readable code.
  - Writing code that is maintainable and follows best practices.

- **Header Files**:
  - How to create and use header files (`main.h`) to organize function prototypes.
  - Understanding the importance of header files in modular programming.

- **Advanced Output Manipulation**:
  - Printing patterns (e.g., lines, squares, triangles) using loops and `_putchar`.
  - Formatting output for specific requirements.

- **Mathematical Operations**:
  - Implementing mathematical operations like multiplication and prime factorization.
  - Understanding how to work with integers and their properties.

- **Control Flow**:
  - Mastering control flow structures like `if`, `else`, and loops (`for`, `while`).
  - Using control flow to handle edge cases and special conditions.

- **Standard Library Usage**:
  - When and how to use the standard library functions effectively.
  - Understanding the limitations of using only `_putchar` for output.

**Conclusion**
This project is designed to strengthen your understanding of functions, loops, and control flow in C. By completing these tasks, you will gain hands-on experience in solving problems with strict constraints, preparing you for more advanced programming challenges.
