# ALX Low-Level Programming - 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

This project focuses on mastering the use of functions and nested loops in the C programming language. You will implement various tasks that involve printing patterns, performing calculations, and manipulating numbers using loops and functions. The project emphasizes understanding function prototypes, variable scope, and the use of header files, while adhering to strict coding standards and restrictions.

* 2-print_alphabet_x10.c: Print the alphabet 10 times in lowercase.
* 3-islower.c: Check if a character is lowercase.
* 4-isalpha.c: Check if a character is an alphabetic letter.
* 5-sign.c: Print the sign of a number (+, 0, or -).
* 6-abs.c: Compute the absolute value of an integer.
* 7-print_last_digit.c: Print the last digit of a number.
* 8-24_hours.c: Print every minute of a day in HH:MM format.
* 9-times_table.c: Print the 9 times table.
* 10-add.c: Add two integers and return the result.
* 11-print_to_98.c: Print all natural numbers from n to 98.


### Advanced Tasks

* 104-fibonacci.c: Print the first 98 Fibonacci numbers without hardcoding.---

### How to Use

- Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd alx-low_level_programming/0x02-functions_nested_loops
```

- Compile the Code:
Use the provided main.c files or create your own to test the functions. For example:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 _putchar.c 0-putchar.c -o 0-putchar
```


- Run the Executable:
```bash
./0-putchar
```

- Check Style:
Use the Betty style checker:

```bash
betty-style.pl <filename>
betty-doc.pl <filename>
```

### Requirements

* Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
* Compiler: GCC with flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
* Editor: vi, vim, or emacs.
* Coding Style: Betty style (checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl).
* File Format: All files must end with a new line.
* Restrictions:
- No global variables.
- No standard library functions like printf or puts.
- Maximum of 5 functions per file.
- Use _putchar for printing characters.
